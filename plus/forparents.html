            <h1><strong>Hello!</strong></h1>
            <p>I created this page for kids, you can join KidsPage too. But, you can't share your art or your new product, but you can manage your kids account.</p>
            <h1><strong>How I can create <em>an account</em> for my kids?</strong></h1>
            <p>So.. you can click create, if you don't have an account or signed out, a create account and a log in button wil appear. <br>
                Click on create account, if you choose: I'm parents, you can create an account and then choose the manage button, if you created a kids account, type its username and
            password to manage. If you choose: I'm kids, when you created your account, you can share arts or let your child share its new arts, mind maps , etc.</p>
            <h1><strong>Teacher</strong></h1>
            <p>Ok, now is teacher. When you create an account, three buttons will appear, Parents, Kids, Teacher. Why i created this "teacher" button?
                Teachers is the same of parents, but they can create classes and share their videos to teach your kids, if your kids is in their classes , your kids can do homeworks, ask the Teachers.
                Teachers can reply the questions.
            </p>
